## Project Overview

The **Club Management System** is a one-stop solution for managing technical clubs, events, and resources efficiently. It fosters a collaborative environment, encourages student engagement, and streamlines processes for club organizers.

## Features
- **User Registration & Login**: Secure access with user roles (Admin, Faculty Mentor, Member, Guest).
- **Event Management**: Create, modify, and track RSVPs for events.
- **Membership Tracking**: Monitor member participation and engagement.
- **Resource Allocation**: Manage booking of equipment and venues.
- **Communication Tools**: Discussion forums and messaging systems for members.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Distinct permissions for Admin, Faculty Mentor, Member, and Guest roles.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Optional: Material-UI/Bootstrap)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (with Mongoose for schema management)
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Deployment**: Heroku, Netlify, MongoDB Atlas
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18.x or later)
- MongoDB (local instance or MongoDB Atlas)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/CMS.git
   cd club-management-system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:  
- For the backend:
```bash
cd server
npm install
```
- For the frontend:
```bash
cd client
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the /server directory and add your configuration**
```bash
MONGO_URI=your-mongo-db-uri
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

4. **Run the project**  
- Backend:
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```
- Frontend:
```bash
cd client
npm start
```
The application should now be running locally on `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend and `http://localhost:5000` for the backend.

## Backend Development
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication is used to handle secure login and registration.
- **APIs**: RESTful APIs for user management, event management, membership tracking, and communication tools are developed with Express.js.
- **Database**: MongoDB is used with Mongoose for schema definition and database operations.

## Frontend Development
- **Component Development**: React components are used for Event List, Member Directory, Resource Booking, etc.
- **State Management**: Managed using Context API or Redux.
- **API Integration**: The frontend communicates with backend APIs using Axios or Fetch for data fetching.

## Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Backend APIs are tested with Jest and Supertest.
- **Integration Testing**: Frontend components and backend APIs are integrated and tested to ensure seamless functionality.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Cypress is used for simulating user interactions and testing the entire workflow.

## Security
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest.
- **User Input Validation**: Inputs are sanitized to prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injections or XSS attacks.
- **Security Audits**: Regular scans and audits using tools like OWASP ZAP.

## Deployment
- **Backend**: The Node.js server can be deployed on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.
- **Frontend**: The React app can be hosted on platforms like Netlify or Vercel.
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas is recommended for hosting the database.
- **CI/CD**: Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions or Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment.

## Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Logging**: Server logs are maintained using Winston.
- **Monitoring**: Application performance can be monitored using New Relic or Datadog.
- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies should be regularly updated to avoid vulnerabilities.

## Future Enhancements
- **Customizable Dashboards**: Personalized dashboards for different user roles.
- **Automated Reminders**: Set up automated reminders for events and deadlines.
- **Integrated Payment Systems**: Add payment gateways for event registrations or membership fees.
- **User Feedback Integration**: Collect feedback through surveys for continuous improvement.

## Documentation and Handover
- **Technical Documentation**: The codebase, APIs, and database schema should be thoroughly documented.
- **User Documentation**: Provide user guides to help navigate the system.
- **Handover**: A detailed handover document should be prepared if the project is transitioned to another team.
